# Install Assistant with the Package Manager

Install Assistant through the Package Manager to launch and use Assistant in the Unity Editor. You can dock the Assistant window in your layout to keep it accessible across workflows.

To install Assistant, follow these steps:

1. In the main menu, go to **Window** > **Package Manager**.

    The **Package Manager** window opens.
2. To find the package, go to **Add** > **Add package by name**.
3. In **Name**, enter `com.unity.ai.assistant`, then select **Add**.

   **AI Assistant** is listed under Package Manager's **In Project** > **Packages - Unity** section.

## Launch the tool

After you install Assistant, follow steps to launch the tool:

1. In the main menu, select **AI** > **Assistant**.
   The **Assistant** window opens.
2. When possible, dock the **Assistant** window. This keeps you from losing the window and launching it multiple times.
