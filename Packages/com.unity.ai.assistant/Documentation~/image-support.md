# Image support

Attach images or allow Assistant to capture screenshots of your Unity Editor to provide visual context in your prompts.

Use image support to describe visual effects, debug rendering or material issues, or communicate an artistic target. You can [attach reference images](xref:attach-image#upload-an-image-from-your-device), share [screenshots](xref:attach-image#capture-a-screenshot), or let Assistant [automatically capture the Editor view](xref:automatic-image-capture) when a request benefits from visual input. Combining visuals with text helps Assistant interpret your project more accurately and provide clearer recommendations.
