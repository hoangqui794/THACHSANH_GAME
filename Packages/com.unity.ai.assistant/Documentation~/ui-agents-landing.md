# UI Agent

Use UI Agent to generate, validate, preview, and save UI Toolkit–based interfaces directly in your Unity project. When you ask Assistant to create or modify a user interface (UI), the request is automatically routed to the UI Agent.

UI Agent is a specialized artificial intelligence (AI) workflow that streamlines UI creation by coordinating multiple tools that handle panel setup, validation, schema generation, previews, and optional saving. It triggers automatically when your prompt includes requests, such as `add a health bar`, `make a start screen UI`, or `design a settings menu`.
