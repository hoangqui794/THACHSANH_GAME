# Attach and capture images in Assistant

Attach or capture images to include visual context with your Assistant prompts. You can upload files, drop images, or capture a screenshot of the Unity Editor directly.

## Upload an image from your device

To attach an image, follow these steps:

1. In the Assistant window, select **+** in the text field.
1. From the dialog window that opens, select **+**.

   The supported formats are `.bmp`, `.exr`, `.gif`, `.hdr`, `.iff`, `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.pct`, `.png`, `.psd`, `.tif`, `.tiff`, and `.tga`.

2. Select an image file from your computer.

   The image is attached next to the text field.

## Drop an image

To attach an image, drag it from your file browser or from your Unity project assets and drop it into the Assistant's text field.
The file attaches automatically next to the text field.

## Capture a screenshot

To capture a screenshot of the Unity Editor and attach it to your prompt, follow these steps:

1. Open the Unity Editor window you want Assistant to capture.

   Assistant only captures the currently focused Unity Editor window, not the entire desktop.

2. In the Assistant window, select **+** in the text field.
3. From the dialog window that opens, select the camera button.

   Assistant captures your current Editor view and attaches it next to the text field.

> [!NOTE]
> No external windows or the desktop are captured as the screenshots are limited to the Unity Editor window only.
