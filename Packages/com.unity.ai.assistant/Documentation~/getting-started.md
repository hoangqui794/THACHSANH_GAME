# Get started with Assistant

Use Assistant to explore ideas, answer questions, and perform actions directly in your Unity project through natural-language prompts. You can use it to inspect your project, generate suggestions, and automate editing tasks from within the Unity Editor.

Assistant operates in two modes: **Ask** and **Agent**. These modes control whether Assistant only provides guidance or also takes action in your project. For more information, refer to [Assistant Ask and Agent modes](xref:assistant-modes).

## Conversation workflow

A typical workflow in the Assistant interface follows this sequence:

1. Select a [mode](xref:assistant-modes) (**Ask** or **Agent**) with the mode selector.
2. (Optional) Attach relevant project data using the **+** button.
3. Enter your question or instruction in the text field.
4. Submit the prompt.
5. Review the response in the conversation area.
6. If Assistant [requests permission](xref:preferences#configure-permission-levels) to act, use the permission prompt to grant or deny it.

When Assistant uses [tools](xref:assistant-tools) to act in your project, the conversation displays a tool entry that you can expand to review parameters and results.

The following table summarizes the key details of each mode, including their purpose, input requirements, output format, and additional notes to help you identify the appropriate mode for your tasks.
