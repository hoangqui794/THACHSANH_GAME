# About Assistant

Assistant is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool integrated into the Unity Editor to help you explore ideas, answer questions, and perform actions directly in your project.

You interact with Assistant through natural-language prompts in a conversation-based interface. Depending on the mode you select, Assistant can either provide guidance only or take action in your scene and assets.

- [**Ask**](xref:assistant-modes#ask-mode) mode focuses on explanation and guidance. In this mode, Assistant answers questions, suggests workflows, and inspects your project using read-only tools. It doesn't modify your scene or assets.

- [**Agent**](xref:assistant-modes#agent-mode) mode focuses on action. In this mode, Assistant can create, modify, or remove objects and assets by calling the Unity tools. All modifying actions respect your permission settings and require your approval.

Use **Ask** mode when you want information, examples, or review without changing your project. Use **Agent** mode when you want Assistant to perform changes for you in the Unity Editor.

For best results, use Assistant with Unity 6 or later.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the **AI** menu and tools in the Unity Editor, ensure that:

* Your project is using Unity 6.3 (6000.3).
* You agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the **AI** menu in the Unity Editor.

For more information, refer to [AI menu in Unity Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.3/Documentation/Manual/ai-menu.html).

Use the Unity Dashboard to [monitor your AI usage](https://cloud.unity.com/home/ai/usage), [manage your point balance](https://cloud.unity.com/home/ai/points), and [configure settings](https://cloud.unity.com/home/ai/settings) across your organization. This helps you understand how often Unity AI is used, control costs, and ensure the right team members have access to the right tools. For more information, refer to the [Unity Dashboard AI settings](https://docs.unity.com/en-us/ai) documentation.
